# Christian Projects

**Christian Projects** is a curated list of Christian projects.

This repository is intended for developers, and so the only approved projects are open source projects, or APIs/services that could be useful to developers and are free to use (i.e. no fees). APIs that charge fees may be included if they offer a free level of access (e.g. 100 requests per day for free).

Please see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on submitting a project or making any other changes.
